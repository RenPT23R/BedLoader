This is Bedloader a "mod loader" made for MCBE/MCPE/MCCE and it just adds an library to the game
# Do Not Forget 1.0.0 is broken use 1.0.1 or up
# Tutorial For Devs
## 1. How to access the API
To access the API just insert in your code ( import { bedloaderAPI } from "/bedloader_bp/Scripts/bedloader.js"; )

## 2. API Features
### The bedloaderAPI contains 4 features
Know the player location ( bedloaderAPI.getPlayerLocation(); )

Know the player dimension ( bedloaderAPI.getPlayerDimension(); )

Know the player list ( bedloaderAPI.getPlayer(); )

And by last open a custom GUI that is technically a popup ( bedloaderAPI.createCustomGUI(text); )

## 3. Loader Block
Does nothing, has a texture, its just used to mage sure that you have bedloader installed correctly you can get by opening chat and writing in ( /give @s bedloader:loader_block )

# Previews
## 1. Sending players to a server (with their permission)
Maybe in version 1.2.0, Bedloader will have a function on the API called sendPlayerServer that could be accesed through ( bedloaderAPI.sendPlayerServer((insert serverIP here), (insert serverPort here), (insert playerName here)); )
## 2. Your suggestions
Suggest here something to bedloader 1.1.0 or 1.2.0
And report bugs in 1.0.0 to be fixed on 1.0.x
